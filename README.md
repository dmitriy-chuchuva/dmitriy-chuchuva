- 👋 Hi, I’m @dmitriy-chuchuva
- 👀 I’m interested in lean software development and realistic devops practices. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Hugo and slowly dabbling away at Rust.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on software development projects to expand my skills and expose myself to more domains as well as expand my AWS, Azure, GCP knowledge. I am always curious about DevOps, Linux, and system administration.
- 📫 Send me an e-mail at dmitriyc@hey.com if you think I can help you or you are interested in a short to medium term work contract.
